Authentication Mechanism
This project uses JWT (JSON Web Tokens) for authentication, powered by SimpleJWT:

Upon successful login, users receive an access token and a refresh token.

The access token is used for accessing secured API endpoints.

When the access token expires, the refresh token can be used to obtain a new access token without needing to log in again.
